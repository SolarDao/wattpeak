# WattPeak

This is the WattPeak monorepo. It contains all the smart contracts related to the WattPeak minter and staking module, 
as well as the frontend(s) for the WattPeak dApp.

## What is WattPeak?
WattPeak is a new revolutionary stable token technology that help speed up the shift to renewable and green energy by actively crowdsourcing new solar energy production around the world.

Each WattPeak token represents 1 Watt-peak (Wp) of grid-connected solar energy production capacity. 
The tokens are backed by real solar energy production capacity and furthermore, the $WP token offers a real yield to users 
by using the revenue from the solar energy production to mint, or buy back from the market, wattpeak tokens which are distributed to stakers.

## How does it work?

What is explained here is the go-to-market design. The design relies upon certain manual processes that will be automated in the future
through smart contracts and oracles.

For WattPeak to work there are multiple components and actors involved.
